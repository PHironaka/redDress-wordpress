## More Effective, More Comfortable Healing

Chronic wounds can be painful, uncomfortable, and difficult to treat. ActiGraft is a revolutionary new wound healing solution that promotes the natural wound healing processes of the body. This treatment is more comfortable, more effective, and more affordable. 

## What is ActiGraft? 

ActiGraft is a first-of-its-kind chronic wound treatment that uses a patient’s own blood to create an in vitro blood clot. This blood clot is then applied to the wound, where it promotes the natural wound healing processes of the body. 

## How does ActiGraft work? 

When injured, your skin is capable of repairing itself and healing the wound. This happens through 4 overlapping processes—hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling. For these processes to work, it’s essential that blood can get to the site of the wound. However, factors like illness, poor circulation, continued pressure, etc. can prevent blood flow to the wound and hinder the healing process. When this happens, an ulcer may form. 

ActiGraft enables health care providers to produce—in real time—in vitro blood clots from the patient’s blood. Applying this blood clot to the site of the wound recreates the natural wound healing environment, and promotes the body’s own healing processes. 

## What are the benefits of ActiGraft? 

ActiGraft revolutionizes the way we treat chronic wounds and delivers significant benefits in terms of comfort, effectiveness, and cost.

### Comfort

- Applied weekly (as opposed to daily for other treatments), meaning less wound interaction and pain.
- Created from the patient's blood, assuring a safe healing process.
- Reduced odor and risk of infection.

### Effectiveness

- Provides the wound with an optimal, natural healing environment, allowing the healing process to proceed unhindered.
- Delivers significantly faster healing. 

### Cost

- Blood clot created from the patient’s own blood, not requiring an external source (such as animal or synthesized) for raw material, keeping costs down. 
- Designed with nurses in mind, ActiGraft can be easily prepared at the patient's bedside in 12 minutes and requires no capital equipment.
- May be covered by Medicare and other forms of insurance.
